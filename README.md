uni assignment. summer 2022.

my very first project of this scale so a lot of the code is written very poorly. one thing in particular that bothers me is the use of global variables.
i couldn't find a way to get rid of them until days later after implementing them all over the code.
i might fix this issue as well as many other little bits of poor code practices.
